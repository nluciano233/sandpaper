# Sandpaper

Useless Discord bot.

After cloning the repo use `bundle` to install the gems needed.

To run the bot use `bundle exec ruby sandpaper.rb`.

Use `ruby manual.rb` to send messages to the chosen channel through the bot.

# Note

If you want the bot to work you will have to manually go into the code and assign the IDs of your discord server channels.
